\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have designed and implemented a framework for distributed
computer vision that allows programmers to easily write their own
applications using domain-specific expertise.  The framework achieved
and exceeded our original goal of building a smart security camera system,
facilitating the development of that and several other sample algorithms.  The framework
comes in two varieties: one that pushes data to a recipient as rapidly as
possible and one that supplies an HTTP-based interface for interacting with
data the camera has collected.  Our performance tests show that, even
in environments where computational power is quite limited, the framework
still achieves frame rates that are limited only by the speed of the network and
the camera itself.  We are excited by the new class of possible
applications that this framework, combined with powerful, inexpensive
hardware and advances in computer vision, has enabled.
