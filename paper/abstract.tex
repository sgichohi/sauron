\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in low-cost, high-performance processors and
computer vision have set the stage for a variety of innovative devices
and applications.  Inspired by the concept of a new generation of
security cameras, we present a C++ and Python framework for
conveniently managing distributed systems of computers equipped
with cameras.  Users define transformations on streams of video
frames, with the framework handling the requisite networking
components and data aggregation.  Initially, the framework eagerly
applied transformations to all frames, the results of which it pushed
to a recipient server.  A subsequent extension allows clients to use an
HTTP-based interface to pull data from cameras, triggering lazy
transformation application.
