# Test: A program that showcases our movement detection algorithm, using input from your webcam. #
##################################################################################################

# This program takes input from your webcam, computes differences in between frames, and displays
# the result. It displays the normalized difference between frames on top of the image. If you
# specify a threshold, it will display a black screen unless the difference is over the threshold.
# This is useful for seeing graphically how well it detects motion. It also shows the detected
# features as red circles.
#
# It works by detecting features in each frame, finding matches between features in adjacent frames,
# and then summing the distances over the best matches. See source code for details.

# Dependencies: CMake version 2.8.9, OpenCV version 2.4.6.1
#               It may work on other versions, but I haven't tried it.

# To make:
cmake .
make

# To run:
./Test THRESHOLD

# Where THRESHOLD is an optional integer argument specifying the threshold for displaying frames.
# The default is to display all frames. I found 140 to be a good value to detect movement.
